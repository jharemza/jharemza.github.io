### Today's Progress

--------------------

1. Continued work on my digital resume by building collections for work experience, skill, prgramming languages, and education.
2. Starting to build a CSS specific to the digiresume layout.

### Thoughts

-------------------

Got quite a bit done on the initial collections, expect to finish that up tomorrow. Also will need a header to the resume that has basic contact info.
