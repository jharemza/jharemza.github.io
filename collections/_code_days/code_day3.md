### Today's Progress

--------------------

1. Created new git branch for developing my digital resume.
2. Continued work on my digital resume by building collections for work experience, skill, prgramming languages, and education.

### Thoughts

-------------------

Didn't spend as much time as I'd like to have spent, but regular progress is good. I can continue tomorrow. I need to get used to focusing on a single task on a single git branch, instead of trying to devolp or fix multiple items on the same branch.
