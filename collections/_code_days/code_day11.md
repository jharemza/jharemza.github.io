### Today's Progress

--------------------

1. Worked on my digital resume - HTML, CSS, Jinja, Jekyll.

### Thoughts

-------------------

Most of this went well. I did have quite an issue with sizing a background imag and placing a logo image and text on top of the bacground image. I plan to continue the struggle tomorrow.
