### Today's Progress

--------------------

1. I got a bootstrap test page to work ... kind of.
2. Working with more CSS to figure out which pices from my main style is conflicting with Bootstrap.

### Thoughts

-------------------

Today wa another short day. Not liking how Boot strap is conflicting with the rest of my stylization. I mau just build some of the functionality and styling on my own as I'm only after a few specific parts of Bootstrap.
