### Today's Progress

--------------------

1. Worked in python.
2. Forked a repo on GitHub called [poker](https://github.com/pokerregion/poker).
3. Trying to solve some poor UI in the PokerStars interface.

### Thoughts

-------------------

So I play poker with som friends in a home league, and these reptitive questions keep coming up. The se include: how did that person win that hand?, how did thier stack get that high?, who reboought?, etc. Its clear Pokerstars has the data and it even displays it sometimes but it goes by too quick or there's only limited info in the UI. So I'm trying to see if I can get more info.
