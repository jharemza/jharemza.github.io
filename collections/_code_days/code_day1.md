### Today's Progress:

--------------------

1. Fixed my [Resume](https://jeremiahharemza.com/resume.html) page on this site. Now my current resume from OneDrive appears there.
2. Built this #100DaysOfCode timeline page using html and CSS.

### Thoughts:

-------------------

I think item 1 was straight forward becaus I had done it before. Still I'd like the  the header and description centered as it looks weird with the resume embed centered and the text not centered.

Item 2 was much harder but not impossible some of my headach was just getting errors from Jekyll when doing `jekyll serve`. Took me a while to build the cards collection, and I need to work on the spacin/layout in CSS but the basics are there.
