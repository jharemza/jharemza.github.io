### Today's Progress

--------------------

1. Spent time understanding the difference between margins, borders, and padding in CSS.
2. Applied the bove to change elements for these cards, as well as various parts of this over all site.

### Thoughts

-------------------

Learned a trick that if i don't want padding from a parent element to apply to certain child elements I can use a negative margin attribute on the child.

Also got better at using dev Chrome dev tools inorder to trace where layout elements are coming from.
