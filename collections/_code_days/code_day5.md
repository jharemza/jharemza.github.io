### Today's Progress

--------------------

1. Finished building collections for work experience, skill, prgramming languages, and education.
2. Continuing to build a CSS specific to the digiresume layout.

### Thoughts

-------------------

Well .. I 99% finished my collections, but at this point I want to start building. The layout and then I can tweek the rest of the collections. I've also been making a few tweaks to this website overall.
