### Today's Progress

--------------------

1. Completed 4 additional lessons for a total of 28 of 56 lessons on [freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)

### Thoughts

-------------------

I like how these lesson are organized. There's a challenge/lesson section focused on learning and reenforcement (some have exercises), and then there's a set of Python projects to do once you complete all of the lessons.
