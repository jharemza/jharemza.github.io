### Today's Progress

--------------------

1. Learned how to [install Bootstrap va Ruby gems](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/download/#rubygems).
2. Learned additional functionality with [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).

### Thoughts

-------------------

Installing boot strap with gems was a lot harder than I expected at least in my particular setup. Most tutorials by other people using both Jekyll and Bootstrap used the compiles CSS and JS. In past I've used Bootsrap with flask via the CDN method.In the end I did figure it out by putting piecing together how jekyll handles scss/sass. Along the way i picked up some additional functionality with bundler while adding and removing gems ... not to mention fixing a continuous mess of error messages.
