### Today's Progress

--------------------

1. more design and layout on the the digital resume.
2. learned about `git stash` and `git stash pop`.
3. Added drop down transitions to card headers for items on my 100 days of code page.

### Thoughts

-------------------

In the end I think I'm going to get rid of Bootstrap and implement some of the pieces I want on my own via my own CSS. Item 3 was easier than expected. I did have to do a few iterations, but still not to bad.
