### Today's Progress

--------------------

1. Researched and tested web3.py for interacting with ehterium contracts.
2. Additional updates on my digital resume.

### Thoughts

-------------------

Originally saw the web3 library used in js for a basic set up to cross check DEX crypto rates. Found a similar implimentation in Python but the methods are not identical so I've had to dig through the documentation. I was fortunate enough to find a Python usage exampl but it is different making it hard to match up all the pieces.
