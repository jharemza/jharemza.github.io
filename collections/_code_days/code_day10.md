### Today's Progress

--------------------

1. Worked in python.
2. Continued working on my poker fork.

### Thoughts

-------------------

While I have skipped a few coding days, I have been working on hardware projects. I built a mining rig to mine cryptocurrencies. As far as the poker library in python it has become apparent I need to step up my debugging skills.
